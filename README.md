Diesel Cycle Simulator

Overview :-
The Diesel Cycle Simulator is a MATLAB project aimed at simulating the thermodynamic processes of a diesel engine cycle. This project provides a comprehensive tool for engineers and students to understand and analyze the performance characteristics of diesel engines.

Features :-
Thermodynamic Simulation: Utilizes MATLAB's computational capabilities to simulate the various processes involved in the diesel engine cycle, including compression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust.
Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust key parameters such as compression ratio, heat addition, and specific heat ratios to explore different operating conditions and engine configurations.
Graphical Visualization: Generates graphical plots of pressure, temperature, volume, and other relevant parameters to visualize the engine cycle and analyze performance trends.
Educational Tool: Designed to be an educational resource for students studying thermodynamics, internal combustion engines, and related fields, providing hands-on experience in engine cycle analysis.
